I had the pleasure of working with him for a few months when I started my position at Taur and, though we were working in different departments, in the open-plan office I'd always see him hard at work on his projects, making a bundle of wires and circuits come to life or using his initiative to solve any arising issues himself. I was always impressed by his meticulousness and the seeming ease with which he accomplished quite complex tasks. Beyond his engineering capabilities, Akram is friendly, bursting with ideas and suggestions, and is an overall delight to work with. He would make a great addition to any team.",

He joined the project team half way through and understood straight away the challenges faced, such as getting the client to cooperate but was willing right from the start to help delivering the best outcome. His delivery is always of very good quality, produced on time and accurate ready to be used for delivery. His good technical knowledge is always very valuable.",
